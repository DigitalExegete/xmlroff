This is part of the xmlroff XSL Formatter project.

See http://www.xmlroff.org/.

This testsuite is used in conjunction with the 'xmlroff-testing'
package to test xmlroff.


Structure
=========

The directory structure, and the <testcases> structure in
testsuite.xml, mostly mirrors the section structure of the XSL 1.0
Recommendation.  There's also additional 'structure' and 'multiple'
directories for tests that don't fit into the divisions within the XSL
spec.


testsuite.xml
=============

This conforms to the DTD for testsuites developed for the Candidate
Recommendation phase testing of the XSL 1.0 spec.

Every test is described by a <test> element.

<test> elements are grouped into <testcases> elements, which may also
be grouped into another <testcases> element or the overall <testsuite>
element.

Every test should have a unique id.


Writing a new test
==================

 - Add the test to testsuite.xml.

 - Test one FO or property per test.

 - Try to include a block of text explaining what the test tests.

 - Try to use yellow and gray for the 'color' and 'background-color'
   properties (or vice-versa) so you can see the extent of blocks.

 - It's okay to write tests that are expected to fail even when the FO
   or property is implemented correctly.  Just make sure the
   description in testsuite.xml makes it clear that the test is
   expected to fail.

 - Except when testing non-basic properties, use properties from the
   'basic' conformance level in preference to using shorthands,
   whenever possible.

   Even when xmlroff supports a shorthand, you don't want to be also
   testing xmlroff's shorthand support when you're testing another FO
   or property, plus using 'basic' properties makes the testsuite more
   useful for other XSL formatters that may not implement the same set
   of shorthands as xmlroff does.

 - Keep the test simple.

 - If you can't keep the test simple, put it in the 'multiple'
   directory and testcases.

 - Use 8in x 11in paper size so the result isn't shrunk if it's
   printed on either A4 or letter size paper.
