No installation is required (or even possible).

You do not need to run 'configure': it is used only when bundling
distributions into .tar.gz files.

To use this testsuite, just make sure that your testing framework
(e.g., the xmlroff 'testing' module) can locate the 'testsuite.xml'
file in this distribution.
