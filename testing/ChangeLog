2011-08-09  Tony Graham

	* [r763] results-doc.xsl: Changing colors of PNG name and
	  'Reference' to match their colors in 'stereo' view to make it
	  easier to remember which one is which.

2011-08-05  Tony Graham

	* [r762] Makefile.am: Stopped making testsuccess.xml twice.

2011-07-29  Tony Graham

	* [r761] testsuites2testresults.xsl: Minor cleanup.

	* [r760] configure.ac: Added another setting to config.h output.

	* [r759] testsuites2testresults.xsl: Incorporating results from
	  current $TEST_RESULTS and other changes so (if testsuites haven't
	  changed) can exactly replicate current test results. Currently
	  guaranteed to break if $TEST_RESULTS does not exist.

2011-07-27  Tony Graham

	* [r758] png+ref2stereo.pl: Wasn't coping if no 'ref' PNGs for a
	  test.

	* [r757] regenerate-testsuccess.pl: Removed unused variable.

	* [r756] common.xsl: When matching command patterns, wasn't coping
	  properly without a default stylesheet.

	* [r755] configure.ac, testsuites2testresults.xsl: Carrying 'title'
	  to and from PI in test results XML.

	* [r754] make-testsuite.pl: Also sorting '\d.fo' files.

	* [r753] README: Added section on 'make-fop-testsuite.pl'.

	* [r752] make-testsuite.pl: Sorting tests with names that differ
	  only in numeric suffix in numeric order.

	* [r751] make-fop-testsuite.pl: Sorting tests with names that
	  differ only in numeric suffix in numeric order.

2011-07-25  Tony Graham

	* [r750] threaded.pl: Reduced 'MaxClients' and 'LogLevel'.

	* [r749] png+ref2stereo.pl: FOP appears to use a hash to store
	  images, so order of '/Im' commands can change between runs when
	  using FOP. Was doing the wrong thing with results when comparing
	  identity of two PNGs.

2011-07-24  Tony Graham

	* [r747] threaded.pl: Allowing '.' in more types of filenames.

	* [r746] results-doc.xsl: Changing background color on links to

2011-07-14  Tony Graham

	* [r741] configure.ac, h2pl.pl, threaded.pl: Setting standalone
	  server port from configure setting.

	* [r740] png+ref2stereo.pl: Back to using 'composite -stereo +0+0'
	  since it shows different colors for additions and deletions
	  (provided the pixels have a red or green component).

	* [r739] png+ref2stereo.pl: More thrashing to stop false positives.

2011-07-13  Tony Graham

	* [r738] png+ref2stereo.pl: Giving false positives for current PDF
	  matching reference.

2011-07-12  Tony Graham

	* [r737] TestCGI.pm, results-doc.xsl, testresults.xsl, threaded.pl,
	  update-results-xml.xsl[CPY]: Reimplemented 'make-results.pl' in
	  TestCGI.pm so can now update test results from 'threaded.pl' web
	  server so no longer need Apache installed to be able to use form
	  in individual results.

	* [r736] make-fop-testsuite.pl: Fixed Perl path.

	* [r735] Makefile.am, configure.ac, png+ref2stereo.pl: Combination
	  of FOP and recent ImageMagick putting in extra metadata in both
	  PDFs and PNGs produced from PDFs so had to get smarter about
	  comparing files. Also using ImageMagick 'compare' to produce
	  better looking 'stereo' files (which aren't really 'stereo' files
	  anymore).

2011-07-08  Tony Graham

	* [r732] configure.ac: Setting project name with command-line
	  option wasn't being reported as an option.

2011-06-01  Tony Graham

	  processed by client-side XSLT.

	* [r701] MyContentParams.pm, MyEventLog.pm, MyWebLog.pm,
	  TestCGI.pm, TestHTTPReq.pm: Modules for 'threaded.pl'.

2011-05-26  Tony Graham

	* [r700] common.xsl, results-doc.xsl, testresults.xsl,
	  testsuccess.xsl: Working on producing individual test reports as
	  XML that is transformed to HTML in client browser.

	* [r699] threaded.pl: Perl threaded http server based on
	  'HTTP::Daemon::Threaded' module.

	  name and current directory name.
