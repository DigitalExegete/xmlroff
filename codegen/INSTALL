Generating the code
===================

  ./configure
  make

Much of the generated code will need to be manually merged with the
existing xmlroff source code.


Make targets
============

make

  Executes the 'all' target.

make all

  Executes the other targets.

make fo-context-dump

  Makes 'fo-context.c', 'fo-context{-private}?.h', which are the C
  source and header files for the FoContext object that xmlroff uses
  when resolving property values.

  You will need to merge the generated files with the existing files
  in the 'xmlroff' package.

make fo-object-dump

  Makes 'fo/fo-*.c', 'fo/fo-*{-private}?.h', which are the C source
  and header files for the supported XSL FO formatting objects; i.e.,
  for the formatting objects listed in 'codegen-info.xml'.

  Files for formatting objects that you've just added to
  'codegen-info.xml' can be copied to 'xmlroff/libfo/fo'.

  Files corresponding to files already in 'xmlroff/libfo/fo' should be
  merged with the existing files.

  Note that if you add a property to 'codegen-info.xsl', you should
  then update the files in 'xmlroff/libfo/fo' for all formatting
  objects that have that new property.

make fo-property-eval-dump

  Makes 'property/fo-property-eval.c', which is the C source for
  relating property attributes to the procedures for evaluating them.
  Copy this file to 'xmlroff/libfo/property'.

make fo-property-object-dump

  Makes 'property/fo-property-*.[ch]', which are the C source and
  header files for the supported XSL FO properties; i.e., for the
  properties listed in 'codegen-info.xml'.

make fo-all-property-h-dump

  Makes 'property/fo-all-property.h', which is a C header file that
  includes the header files for all supported XSL FO properties.  Copy
  this file to 'xmlroff/libfo/property'.

make property-entity-decl-dump

  Makes 'xmlroff-property-decl.ent', which is used when generating
  the xmlroff reference manual.  Copy this file to 'xmlroff/docs'.

make property-entity-ref-dump

  Makes 'xmlroff-property-ref.ent', which is used when generating the
  xmlroff reference manual.  Copy this file to 'xmlroff/docs'.
