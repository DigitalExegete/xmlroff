	* [r384] COPYING, configure.ac: Thanks to the efforts of Jon Bosak
	  of Sun and of Mike Anastasio of Sun's Intellectual Property Law
	  Group, Sun has approved the re-release of xmlroff under this BSD
	  license (essentially the same as the old one with the nuclear
	  paragraph removed). Changes made since Sun released the original
	  source code and ceased its involvement with the project are
	  similarly relicensed.
	  
	  Version number upped to 0.6.0 to mark the change in license
	  terms.

	  complicated.
