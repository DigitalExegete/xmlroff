This is part of the xmlroff XSL Formatter project.

xmlroff is a fast, free, high-quality, multi-platform XSL formatter
that aims to excel at DocBook formatting and that integrates easily
with other programs and with scripting languages.

The xmlroff XSL Formatter is a library -- libfo -- and a command-line
program -- xmlroff -- for formatting XML according to the XSL 1.0
Recommendation.

See http://xmlroff.org/.

The version numbers of 'codegen' releases are the same as the
version of xmlroff that is current at the time of the 'codegen'
release.

The stylesheets in this directory are used to generate C source and
header files for xmlroff from the XML for the XSL 1.0 Recommendation
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xsl-20011015/xslspec.xml).

The generated files are not guaranteed to be drop-in replacements for
the existing xmlroff source code and header files, since many of the
xmlroff source code and header files have had manual modifications.

You should use Emacs's ediff or some other diff/merge utility to
compare the generated file and the existing version and only change
what should be changed.

The exception are the .c and .h files created for a property that has
just been added to codegen-info.xml: since the property's files didn't
exist before, you can just copy the generated files to the xmlroff
source code.


Files
=====

The significant files are:

   ChangeLog			Change log for the stylesheets, etc.
   README			This file
   conversion-lib.xsl		Stylesheet with common templates
   codegen-info.xml		XML file controlling output
   fo-all-property-h-dump.xsl   Stylesheet for generating fo-all-property.h
   fo-context-dump.xsl		Stylesheet for generating fo-context.[ch]
   fo-object-dump.xsl		Stylesheet for generating fo-*.c and
				  fo-*{-private}?.h
   fo-property-object-dump.xsl	Stylesheet for generating fo-property-*.[ch]
   makefile			Makefile
   xmlroff-property-decl-dump.xsl
                                Stylesheet for generating entity declarations
				  for property documentation files
   xmlroff-property-ref-dump.xsl
                                Stylesheet for generating entity references
				  for property documentation files

Any other XSL files are evolutionary dead ends.


Make targets
============

make

  Executes the 'all' target.

make all

  Executes the 'fo-context-dump', 'fo-object-dump',
  'fo-property-object-dump', 'fo-all-property-h-dump',
  'property-entity-decl-dump', and 'property-entity-ref-dump' targets.

make fo-context-dump

  Makes 'fo-context.c', 'fo-context{-private}?.h', which are the C
  source and header files for the FoContext object that xmlroff uses
  when resolving property values.

  You will need to merge the generated files with the existing files
  in the 'xmlroff' package.

make fo-object-dump

  Makes 'fo/fo-*.c', 'fo/fo-*{-private}?.h', which are the C source
  and header files for the supported XSL FO formatting objects; i.e.,
  for the formatting objects listed in 'codegen-info.xml'.

  Files for formatting objects that you've just added to
  'codegen-info.xml' can be copied to 'xmlroff/fo'.

  Files corresponding to files already in 'xmlroff/fo' should be
  merged with the existing files.

  Note that if you add a property to 'codegen-info.xsl', you should then
  update the files in 'xmlroff/fo' for all formatting objects that
  have that new property.

make fo-property-object-dump

  Makes 'property/fo-property-*.[ch]', which are the C source and
  header files for the supported XSL FO properties; i.e., for the
  properties listed in 'codegen-info.xml'.

make fo-all-property-h-dump

  Makes 'property/fo-all-property.h', which is a C header file that
  includes the header files for all supported XSL FO properties.  Copy
  this file to xmlroff/property.

make property-entity-decl-dump

  Makes 'xmlroff-property-decl.ent', which is used when generating
  the xmlroff reference manual.  Copy this file to xmlroff/docs.

make property-entity-ref-dump

  Makes 'xmlroff-property-ref.ent', which is used when generating the
  xmlroff reference manual.  Copy this file to xmlroff/docs.
