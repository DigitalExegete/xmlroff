The stylesheets in this directory are used to generate C source and
header files for xmlroff from the XML for the XSL 1.0 Recommendation
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xsl-20011015/xslspec.xml, included as
'xslspec.xml').

This is part of the xmlroff XSL Formatter project.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
xmlroff is a fast, free, high-quality, multi-platform XSL formatter
that aims to excel at DocBook formatting and that integrates easily
with other programs and with scripting languages.

The xmlroff XSL Formatter is a library -- libfo -- and a command-line
program -- xmlroff -- for formatting XML according to the XSL 1.0
Recommendation.

See http://xmlroff.org/.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The version numbers of 'codegen' releases are the same as the
version of xmlroff that is current at the time of the 'codegen'
release.

The generated files are not guaranteed to be drop-in replacements for
the existing xmlroff source code and header files, since many of the
xmlroff source code and header files have had manual modifications.

You should use Emacs's ediff or some other diff/merge utility to
compare the generated file and the existing version and only change
what should be changed.

The exception are the .c and .h files created for a property that has
just been added to codegen-info.xml: since the property's files didn't
exist before, you can just copy the generated files to the xmlroff
source code.
