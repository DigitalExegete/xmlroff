XML 2003 "XSL FO Chef's Tools Exhibition" Samples
=================================================

The files in this directory are (mostly) the sample files from the
"XSL FO Chef's Tools Exhibition" that was presented at the XML 2003
conference in Philadelphia in December 2003 by Tommie Usdin of
Mulberry Technologies.

The results from multiple XSL formatters' processing of the samples
will be summarised on the Mulberry web site after the conference.

Some sample files include markup that is contrary to the XSL 1.0
Recommendation, and some use formatting objects that the current
version of xmlroff does not support.  You should run fixup.xsl on the
provided sample files: e.g.,

   xsltproc fixup.xsl Sample1.fo > Sample1.fix.fo

to make versions that conform to the Recommendation and that xmlroff
can better handle.

Apart from using normalize-space() on text nodes, the stylesheet
outputs a message whenever it corrects or otherwise modifies the
input.
