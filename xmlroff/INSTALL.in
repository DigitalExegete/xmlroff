Introduction
------------
xmlroff is an open source XSL formatter. xmlroff has the ability of  
rendering XSL-FO as PDF documents and therefore can be particularly
interesting to a variety of individuals and projects (e.g. UBL
enthusiasts can render XSL-FO transformations of their documents to
PDF).

xmlroff is also an alpha technology and as such it's
building/installation can be daunting.

The goal of this document is to provide a concise but useful guide
to the compilation and installation of xmlroff for beginners on a
typical modern linux system (such as Debian 9), paying especial
attention to details which would otherwise rely on knowledge of
C development under linux.

Experts in the compilation of alpha/beta level software on linux
platforms will probably want to skip this document. 

DISCLAIMER
----------

I realize the information on this document is pretty
unpolished and makes lots of assumptions about your system. I hope such
assumptions are correct for most modern cases (the main target was
individual users in linux platforms such as Debian 9), and hope the net
effect of this document is positive, but I don't guarantee it in any
way.  

This document does not replace any official documentation, and is
provided WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR PROMISE EXPLICIT OR IMPLICIT.




Overview of the Process
-----------------------
The process is ideally very simple:

1. download xmlroff
2. Install the dependencies
3. run make
4. run make install (as root)

Instead of providing a generalized version of those steps, assuming
you know how to build C programs in linux (that is the goal general
install notes are for), I will assume that you have a typical modern
workstation configuration and don't know much about building
software from scratch on linux.

Download xmlroff
----------------
Get the	xmlroff source from http://xmlroff.org/


Installing dependencies
-----------------------
xmlroff depends on a number of packages: libgnomeprint, pango,
cairo, libxml2, libxslt, GTK2, GLib and GObject.

I recommend you use your package manager utility (most systems
nowadays have KPackage installed as part of the standard KDE
environment) to install the most recent packaged versions of each
software.

When you are installing the packages, you will notice that next to
some of them, there are similar packages with the '-dev' (or '-devel')
suffix. You will want to install those too, they include header files
you need to compile against later. In particular you want to select
from the package list libgnome2-dev and libxslt-dev for installation.


Building xmlroff
----------------

Now, untar xmlroff :

   tar zxvf xmlroff-@VERSION@.tar.gz

Now you should be ready. Inside the xmlroff directory do these
three: 
 
   ./configure

   make

   make install

When building from a Subversion checkout, use './autogen.sh' instead
of './configure'.


TESTING
-------

Format the man page for xmlroff:

   xmlroff docs/xmlroff.fo 

The result is written to layout.pdf.


ENSURING COMPATIBILITY
----------------------

xmlroff includes a 'libfo-compat.xsl' stylesheet that you can run on
your FO files to help ensure that they use only the subset of the XSL
specification that xmlroff supports.

The stylesheet is built in to xmlroff, and the compatibility
processing is enabled by default.

'libfo-compat.xsl' attempts to rewrite or remove elements and
attributes that cause problems for xmlroff.  The formatted result may
not be what you expect, but you are more likely to get formatted
output if you do run the compatibility processing on problematic
files.

To turn off the compatibility processing, use the '--nocompat' option.

xmlroff prints a copy of the built-in stylesheet when you use the
'--compat-stylesheet' option, plus when you install xmlroff,
'libfo-compat.xsl' typically installs in
/usr/share/xml/libfo-@VERSION@ or /usr/local/share/xml/libfo-@VERSION@.

There are many ways to use the stylesheet:

 - Directly using xmlroff

      xmlroff in.fo

   or

      xmlroff --compat in.fo

 - Directly using xsltproc

      xsltproc /usr/share/xml/libfo-@VERSION@/libfo-compat.xsl in.fo > out.fo

 - Directly using xmlroff and xsltproc

      xmlroff --compat-stylesheet > libfo-compat.xsl
      xsltproc libfo-compat.xsl in.fo > out.fo

 - Using XML catalogs

   Add the following two lines to /etc/xml/catalog:

     <delegateURI uriStartString="http://xmlroff.org/release/libfo/@VERSION@" catalog="file:///usr/local/share/xml/libfo-@VERSION@/catalog.xml"/>
     <delegateURI uriStartString="http://xmlroff.org/release/libfo/current" catalog="file:///usr/local/share/xml/libfo-@VERSION@/catalog.xml"/>

   then use the URI for the stylesheet:

      xsltproc http://xmlroff.org/release/libfo/current/libfo-compat.xsl in.fo > out.fo

 - Using pkg-config

   The pkg-config file for libfo defines a variable for the location
   of 'libfo-compat.xsl':

      xsltproc `pkg-config --variable=compat_stylesheet libfo-0.5` in.fo > out.fo

When you supply a 'verbose' parameter with a non-false value when
using 'libfo-compat.xsl' with xsltproc, the stylesheet prints status
messages explaining what is being modified.
