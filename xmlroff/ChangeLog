	Thanks to the efforts of Jon Bosak of Sun and of Mike Anastasio of
	Sun's Intellectual Property Law Group, Sun has approved the re-
	release of xmlroff under this BSD license (essentially the same as
	the old one with the nuclear paragraph removed).  Changes made since
	Sun released the original source code and ceased its involvement with
	the project are similarly relicensed.

	Version number upped to 0.6.0 to mark the change in license terms.
