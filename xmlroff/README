This directory includes the xmlroff XSL Formatter.

xmlroff is a fast, free, high-quality, multi-platform XSL formatter
that aims to excel at DocBook formatting and that integrates easily
with other programs and with scripting languages.

The xmlroff XSL Formatter is a library -- libfo -- and a command-line
program -- xmlroff -- for formatting XML according to the XSL 1.0
Recommendation.

See http://xmlroff.org/.

To test xmlroff:

   ./xmlroff xmlroff.fo

PDF output is written to layout.pdf.

xmlroff.fo documents the xmlroff command-line options and parameters,
so you can use the formatted output as a guide for running xmlroff.


Compatibility
=============

Details of the compatibility with the XSL 1.0 Specification of the
current xmlroff version is shown in the xmlroff manual (see
'./docs/html/index.html') and on the xmlroff website at
http://xmlroff.org/conformance.html.

Use the libfo-compat.xsl stylesheet (both built into xmlroff and
installed when you installed xmlroff) to remove some of the formatting
objects and properties that cause problems when using xmlroff.

To invoke the built-in libfo-compat.xsl stylesheet when running
xmlroff:

   xmlroff --compat xmlroff.fo

To write a copy of the built-in libfo-compat.xsl stylesheet:

   xmlroff --compat-stylesheet > libfo-compat.xsl

To get the location of the installed libfo-compat.xsl stylesheet:

   pkg-config --variable=compat_stylesheet libfo-0.5


Dependencies
============

libfo depends on GNOME Print, GDK, Pango, PangoXSL, libxml2, libxslt,
GLib, and GObject.

xmlroff distributions include a bundled copy of PangoXSL so you don't
have to download it separately.

If you are compiling the Cairo backend, libfo also depends on Cairo
and on Pango 1.10 or later.

Building libfo additionally requires Perl.

The xmlroff executable additionally depends on popt.

See the xmlroff website for further details.
