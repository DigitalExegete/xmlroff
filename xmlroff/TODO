Convert 'proportional-column-width' datatype to compound datatype

   It would be simpler if the 'proportional-column-width' datatype was
   a compound datatype with 'length' and 'proportional' components.
   This would reduce the calculations done when a table has no columns
   with proportional width.

Convert fo-expr-context-private.h _get_ functions to macros

   Macros were turned into functions when the header file was going to
   be publicly visible, but since it is now private to the expression
   parsing code, the functions could easily be made into macros again.

Merge all enumeration tokens into one large GEnum

   Since, in principle, a property can get its value from almost any
   other property type by using inherited-property-value(),
   from-parent(), from-nearest-specified-value(), or
   from-table-column(), maybe all enumeration tokens should be in one
   large GEnum, with a property required to check that a particular
   value from another property is valid for the current property.

   Maybe this doesn't fit with the current practise of turning
   enumeration tokens into resolved values straight away.

Remove 'context' parameter from _resolve_enum() functions

   The FoContext is unnecessary once none of the _resolve_enum()
   functions handle the 'inherit' keyword.

   This will also affect _validate() functions of properties, since
   they will also no longer need a 'context' parameter.

Convert property value calculations to use functions in fo-datatype.h

   Calculations involving property datatype's values can be simplified
   by using the functions in fo-datatype.h.

Update remaining formatting objects and properties to match current
spec-dump

   This is a never-ending process while the spec-dump stylesheets are
   being continually tweaked.
